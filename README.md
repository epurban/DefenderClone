# DefenderClone
My attempt to recreate one of my favorite 1980s Arcade games using MonoGame and C#. I do not own this game and this code is for demonstration of coding abilities ONLY. Defender was originally programmed by Eugene Jarvis in the 1980s.

The goal is for the game to look and play as close to the original as possible:
